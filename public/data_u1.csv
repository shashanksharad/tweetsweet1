 re considering 1st paragraph edit i don t understand the reasons for s recent edit of this article not that i m sure that the data are necessarily wrong rather i m persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject i note that articles about other sitting justices have been similarly enhanced and i also believe those changes are no improvement in support of my view that this edit should be reverted i would invite anyone to re visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists a1 benjamin cardozo a2 learned hand b1 john marshall harlan b2 john marshall harlan ii the question becomes would the current version of the wikipedia article about any one of them or either pair be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph i think not perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument kathleen sullivan of stanford law makes when she suggests that some on the harvard law faculty wonder how antonin scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging i would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point less humorous but an even stronger argument is the one clarence thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to yale at a minimum i m questioning this edit it deserves to be reconsidered ,0,2021-02-04,0,34,213,23

 more i can t make any real suggestions on improvement i wondered if the section statistics should be later on or a subsection of types of accidents i think the references may need tidying so that they are all in the exact same format ie date format etc i can do that later on if no one else does first if you have any preferences for formatting style on references or want to do it yourself please let me know there appears to be a backlog on articles for review so i guess there may be a delay until a reviewer turns up it s listed in the relevant form eg wikipedia good article nominations ,0,2021-04-29,0.469,186,86,30

before you start throwing accusations and warnings at me lets review the edit itself making ad hominem attacks isn t going to strengthen your argument it will merely make it look like you are abusing your power as an admin now the edit itself is relevant this is probably the single most talked about event int he news as of late his absence is notable since he is the only living ex president who did not attend that s certainly more notable than his dedicating an aircracft carrier i intend to revert this edit in hopes of attracting the attention of an admin that is willing to look at the issue itself and not throw accusations around quite so liberally perhaps if you achieve a level of civility where you can do this we can have a rational discussion on the topic and resolve the matter peacefully ,0,2021-06-04,0.12,191,319,25
